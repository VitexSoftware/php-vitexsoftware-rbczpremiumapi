    ##### API Overview
    - Accounts list and balance
    - Transaction overview (also for saving accounts)
    - Payments import
    - Statement list and download
    - FX rates

    ##### Authentication
    Before making a call to Premium API, you need to register your app at our _Developer portal_. This is where you get the **ClientID** that your application must send in the request as `X-IBM-Client-Id`. This is the key that grants your app access to the API.

    However, this may not be enough. Your application needs to use mTLS to call most operations here. Thus, you not only need _https_ but also a client certificate issued by us. The exception is two operations for FX rates that are accessible also without a client certificate.

    Each bank client/user can issue several certificates. Each certificate can permit different sets of operations (http methods) on different bank accounts. All this must be configured in Internet Banking first by each bank client/user (bank clients need to look under _Settings_ and do not forget to download the certificate at the last step). The certificate is downloaded in **PKCS#12** format as **\*.p12** file and protected by a password chosen by the bank client/user. Yes, your app needs the password as well to get use of the **\*p12** file for establishing mTLS connection to the bank.

    Client certificates issued in Internet Banking for bank clients/users have limited validity (e.g. **5 years**). However, **each year** certificates are automatically blocked and bank client/user must unblock them in Internet Banking. It is possible to do it in advance and prolong the time before the certificate is blocked. Your app should be prepared for these scenarios and it should communicate such cases to your user in advance to provide seamless service and high user-experience of your app.

    For testing purposes please download and use our <a href="assets/test_cert.p12" download> test client certificate</a>. The certificate password is <i>Test12345678</i>.

    ##### Rate Limiting
    In production environment the request rate is limited according to your subscription plan. Therefore the consumer must be able to handle HTTP responses status 429 in case of exceeding these limits.

    Response headers `X-RateLimit-Limit-Second` and `X-RateLimit-Limit-Day` show the actual limits configured for the specific operation. Response headers `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Second` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Day` are returned to help prevent the limits from being exceeded.

    ##### Notes
    Be aware, that in certain error situations, API can return specific error structures along with 5xx status code, which is not explicitely defined below.

    ##### Quick Start Client
    Feel free to download a <a href="assets/PremiumApiClient.java" download>simple Java client</a> that gives you quick access to our API.

        Importing batch payments in one of [supported
        formates](https://www.rb.cz/attachments/direct-banking/ekomunikator-datova-struktura.pdf)
        - see request parameter `Batch-Import-Format`.


        This is an API alternative to the manual import of batch payments through
        [Internet
        Banking](https://www.rb.cz/podnikatele/ucty-a-platebni-styk/prime-bankovnictvi/internetove-bankovnictvi/caste-dotazy/import-hromadnych-plateb).


        Imported payments are not immediately processed, they are just loaded into
        Internet Banking and they still must be authorized/certified in Internet
        Banking according to client settings of disposable rights and
        signatures.


        Once authorized/certified, uploaded payments will be processed in the
        Instant payments mode if the following conditions are met&#58;

        1. the batch has no more than 100 payments

        2. no more than 10 batches per day were uploaded

        3. individual payments meet the conditions for Instant payments - see
        [Instant
        Payments](https://www.rb.cz/informacni-servis/platebni-styk/tuzemske-platby/okamzite-platby)

        4. on the weekend, only payments within our bank are processed as Instant payments


        The number of transactions in one request is limited to 15.000 (this can
        change without prior notice). The limit is not checked during the call, 
        it is performed later and a possible error is provided in Internet Banking.
